# Following steps:

Step-by-Step Process:

## 1.Data Extraction:

Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository using scripting. This can be done using Git commands or a Git library in a programming language like Python.
Store the cloned repository in a local directory.

## 2.Data Transformation:

Use a scripting language like Python and import libraries such as Pandas to manipulate and preprocess the data.
Read the required files (e.g., CSV, JSON) from the cloned repository into a Pandas DataFrame.
Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.

## 3.Database Insertion:

Install the MySQL database server and create a new database to store the Phonepe pulse data.
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to the MySQL database.
Create a table schema that matches the structure of the transformed data.
Insert the transformed data into the MySQL database using SQL commands.

## 4.Dashboard Creation:

Install Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python.
Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for the dashboard.
Utilize Plotly's geospatial mapping functions to display the data on a map.
Design the dashboard with interactive features such as dropdown menus for users to select different facts and figures.
Use appropriate Plotly charts and visualizations to present the insights derived from the data.

## 5.Data Retrieval:

Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database.
Fetch the required data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame.
Update the dashboard dynamically with the latest data by incorporating the retrieved data into the Streamlit and Plotly components.

## 6.Deployment:

Ensure the solution is secure by following best practices for database and web application security.
Thoroughly test the solution to ensure it functions as intended and handles edge cases gracefully.
Deploy the dashboard publicly using a suitable platform (e.g., cloud hosting, local server).
Make the dashboard accessible to users by providing a URL or deploying it on a domain.
By following this step-by-step process, you can extract, transform, and visualize the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an efficient and user-friendly manner. The resulting dashboard will provide valuable insights and information, enhancing the understanding of the repository's metrics and statistics.
